# CCT_Controller
Software to upload to an Arduino-capable chip to control CCT (Dual white) LED strips.
Feel free to use this code for **non-commercial** personal projects.

The goal of this project is to create a custom CCT (dual-white) LED controller. The board being used is a custom PCB I have designed, but can be easily replicated on any Arduino with some additional componants.
